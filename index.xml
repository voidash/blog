Python fits into that domain perfectly and it is pleasant to write scripts in python. But what about Rust? The language doesn&amp;rsquo;t even come with a garbage collector, and you might as well fight its borrow checker until it deems your code is memory safe.</description></item><item><title>Rust New Competitor to C and C++</title><link>https://voidash.github.io/blog/posts/2021/rust-new-competitor-to-c-and-c++/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Dec 2021 17:20:48 +0545</pubDate><guid>https://voidash.github.io/blog/posts/2021/rust-new-competitor-to-c-and-c++/</guid><description>This post tries to reason why Rust might be choice for new projects instead of C and C++. This is a bold statement and there is a need to discuss the types of projects where a comparision is being made. i.e Systems Programming. Going back a bit further, and taking a look at the motivation for these languages shines a beam of light about the main goal of these languages.</description></item><item><title>How To Install Rust And The Linker It Requires On Linux</title><link>https://voidash.github.io/blog/posts/2021/install-rust-linux/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Dec 2021 08:23:51 +0545</pubDate><guid>https://voidash.github.io/blog/posts/2021/install-rust-linux/</guid><description>This post discusses how to install rust on linux.

I should assess the situation, understand the condition, and make plans according to it but Somehow my brain manages to abstract things out.</description></item><item><title>Types of Operating systems on basis of processing</title><link>https://voidash.github.io/blog/posts/2019/operating-systems/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2019 00:00:00 +0545</pubDate><guid>https://voidash.github.io/blog/posts/2019/operating-systems/</guid><description>Migrated from logicaletter.com
Operating system is system software that manages the resources of computer, one that directly talks to your hardware. When your computer boots up , operating system is loaded into your main memory and and it starts performing tasks. These tasks are processes for your computer and depending upon the task you may have one or many processes for a single task. To have a better understanding, if you are on Windows , Take a look at Task manager and you will find a Running processes tab.</description></item><item><title>AC Vs DC : which is more dangerous?</title><link>https://voidash.github.io/blog/posts/2018/ac-dc/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0545</pubDate><guid>https://voidash.github.io/blog/posts/2018/ac-dc/</guid><description>Migrated from logicaletter.com If You are looking for quick answer then AC is dangerous. So what makes Alternating current more dangerous than Direct Current? I guess we should take a look at their own respective features. Features of Direct Current
Direct Current Direct Current Voltage – Time Graph
If DC source is rated for X Volts then maximum voltage that DC source can provide is X. if your Source is rated for 12 V then max Voltage it can provide is 12 V.</description></item><item><title>Alias Linux Command Explained succintly</title><link>https://voidash.github.io/blog/posts/2018/alias-linux/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0545</pubDate><guid>https://voidash.github.io/blog/posts/2018/alias-linux/</guid><description>Migrated from logicaletter.com
Purpose to substitute a String in place of commands used in linux. Note: commands can include paramaters too.
If you are familar with CMD then you would certainly know cls clears the screen. but in linux shell there is command called clear to wipe out terminal junk. so if i want to use cls in linux or unix like OS terminals then i would use $ alias cls='clear'</description></item><item><title> Understanding inheritance in java : SuperclassVariable can reference a Subclass Variable</title><link>https://voidash.github.io/blog/posts/2018/understading-inheritance-java/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0545</pubDate><guid>https://voidash.github.io/blog/posts/2018/understading-inheritance-java/</guid><description>Migrated from logicaletter.com
Superclass : A parent class Subclass : A child class that inherits Superclass
class A{ //superclass or parent class //some generic code } class B extends A{ //subclass or child class of A //some generic code } it may seem esoteric at first, but its true that superclass variable can reference a subclass object .This aspect is quite useful when superclass object needs parameters same as subclass object which is not part of that superclass object.</description></item><item><title>Linux Chmod command explained</title><link>https://voidash.github.io/blog/posts/2018/chmod/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Aug 2018 00:00:00 +0545</pubDate><guid>https://voidash.github.io/blog/posts/2018/chmod/</guid><description>Migrated from logicaletter.com
CHMOD aka Change mode is the command present in linux or unix like systems. Purpose
To change the mode of a file for specified user classes according to specified permissions with different function.
Making it simpler it is used to change the permission of file . The basic syntax looks like
chmod options permissions filename Permissions Permissions are boundary for file access that can be defined for each user classes.</description></item><item><title>The Art of Multithreading in java(Java programming guide)</title><link>https://voidash.github.io/blog/posts/2018/multithreading-java/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Jun 2018 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://voidash.github.io/blog/posts/2018/multithreading-java/</guid><description>Migrated from logicaletter.com

Lets start why generics is needed rather than identifying what generics really are. Through the use of generics one can create classes,interfaces and methods and specify what kind of data it is working upon. Lets start up with example : Many algorithms logic is same no matter what kind of data they are working upon. Stack algorithm logic is same no matter which type of data you are working with ,i.</description></item><item><title>Algorithms : A brief example</title><link>https://voidash.github.io/blog/posts/2018/what-is-algorithm/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 May 2018 00:00:00 +0545</pubDate><guid>https://voidash.github.io/blog/posts/2018/what-is-algorithm/</guid><description>Migrated from logicaletter.com

There are five laws of stoichiometry which are basis for understanding fundamental concepts of chemistry. Those five laws are:
Law of conservation of mass Law of constant or definite proportions Law of multiple proportions Law of equivalent or reciprocal proportions Law of gaseous volume Law of conservation of mass It states that total mass of reactant is equal to total mass of product or simply put any substance that undergoes chemical reaction will have same mass throughout the reaction.</description></item><item><title>9's complement Method: Computers use those?</title><link>https://voidash.github.io/blog/posts/2017/computers-subtract/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Mar 2017 00:00:00 +0545</pubDate><guid>https://voidash.github.io/blog/posts/2017/computers-subtract/</guid><description>Migrated from logicaletter.com
computers are intricate to understand at the superficial level, but at its core all you will see are logic. Logic makes everything. The invention of transistors allowed us to create logic gates and those logic gates allow computers to add. couple of XOR gates and AND gates can create a full adder. but how do computers subtract? they use something called 1’s complement because computer developers thought “screw this , we are not going to build another circuit for subtraction, rather we will use same circuit board that we use for addition”.</description></item><item><title>Random</title><link>https://voidash.github.io/blog/random/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://voidash.github.io/blog/random/</guid><description>archives</description></item></channel></rss>
