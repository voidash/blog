All the design pattern revolve around objects. Objects here is more vague and is not to be taken as OOP term. It might mean algebraic Data type, User Defined Type or a record or a function itself.

Four types of Design Patterns 

- Behavioural Patterns : How to perform Communication between Objects

- Creational Patterns : Creation of objects

- Structural Patterns : Arranges the structure of Objects or relationship among them 

- Anti Pattern : Solution to particular problem involving objects we know are ineffective
