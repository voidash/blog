> this blogpost is part of the assigment given to us on course ENGT 102. Just posting because it reminds me of my shortcomings.

## Handling the situation:

The train is out of the track; Deviated from its journey. Looks like its heading the opposite path. How can i bring it back? I should assess the situation, understand the condition, and make plans according to it but Somehow my brain manages to abstract things out. Not this time; 

i have a problem with my retention of vocabulary, my problem solving skills, my persuasive skills and in overall my passive way of learning things. That is not how a society changing figure is born. 

The irony of thinking that i am not genetically gifted; when i am a human who is on top of the food chain. It only make sense when i juxtapose me with a successful entrepreneur. When i try to understand myself, my narrow viewpoint, sparse susceptibility to change, low motivation and self loathing is not going to work.

I know i lack behind these areas but Acknowledgement itself is not going to fill the plate. i should clear out the clutter . I will go for a walk. instead of Listening to random hip-pity hop-pity western electronic songs . i will grab a interesting Audio-book instead of valorant. But seriously some kind of action is needed.

I really need to understand that when someone is good at something; acknowledge them instead of criticizing them; i need to go and learn from them or compete with them but i shouldn't give some lame excuses. 

Truth to be told I am frightened by the fact that i lack behind in many areas, trying to ask them might make be  look stupid ; This time i am not escaping this reality to further make it worse. I am accessing them, giving them the time so i can explain to myself, why this is happening and how can i resolve it.

Also i completed the book five elements of effective thinking , These are the things that i grasped

1. Prejudices will hit; don't suppress them, identify and debug them
2. Make things simple, what could be the simple case of this
3. Make sure that you are standing on a strong base.
4. rebuttal, or what one might say a opposing perspective is important.
5. think before you speak;
