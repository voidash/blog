- "There are no shortcuts in ~~programming~~ problem solving". Looking at the post [The Best Programmers I know](https://endler.dev/2025/best-programmers/), I am reminded of my worst mental model when it comes to programming problems. I believe that "If the task is simple enough then it is not necessary to touch the fundamentals of the tool i am using for finding solution, hoping somebody else has already encountered it and there will be solutions around the internet", This surprisingly works for lots of tasks but there are cases where
	- I misjudge the problem and it turns out to be gory mess which requires significantly more effort
	- The problem is big one which requires dividing into  into smaller sub-problems. As i start, the sub-problems are simple enough. But suddenly i encounter the piece that doesn't fit to the big problem puzzle easily and requires a bit of Malleating and sanding. 
	The latter part is where i strike my nails with "Googling hammer" which could have been avoided in the first place if i read the manual in the first place. 
	
"This is a reminder to always look at the source of truth, and know your tools well enough that you can understand the nuance of every minor details"

- We had a communication class by [Mannsi Agrawal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mannsi-agrawal/). Two things stuck with me 
	   - PREP(Point Reason Example Point). This can change how you vocalize your thoughts. The whole meme around what i think vs what i speak can be flipped with this method. You got to start with the point you are trying to make, give a reason on why you are making this point, provide some examples and then end with a point.

	- She was told to talk about watermelon and that turned to a beautiful story in rajhasthan where the heat was beaten with a quench of watermelon juice. Then we started asking about random things. Every thing we talked about, she turned to a beautiful stories that could be a conversation starters. That made me think, I got to have curiosity about random things in my life. I should to be more proactive regarding all this. The goal is something like this: When you see a toothpick and you should be able to fabricate a story with some realistic facts about toothpicks
