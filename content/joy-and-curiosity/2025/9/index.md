> Newton didn't discover gravity under the tree in front of kings college in Cambridge to get a job at OpenAI.

- [Until Death, all defeat is psychological.](https://x.com/wojakcodes/status/1898356531822748053)

- [Why Being delusional is superpower](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LopI4YeC4I). Time and time again i am reminded of this awesome video. Luck and Hard-work is a gestalt that allows success. And if you are already lucky, try increasing others luck surface area.

- [The Bitter Lesson](http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html) by Richard Sutton tries to clarify that researchers on AI tend to work on two modes, where they are trying to mimic human understanding with a notion of constant compute or in a massive compute space. The state space search utilized massive compute to win over Gary Kasparov, or [Hidden Markov Models](Hidden Markov Models "wikilink") in speech recognition which are statistical models which performs better than human centric approach.
  Thinking of simple general purpose ways that scales with increased computation instead of trying to reverse engineer how the human brain does it is what we should strive for most of the specialized tasks. He says "Building in how we think we think doesn't work in the long run." The two methods that seems to scale arbitrarily is $search$ and $learning$. Gradient descent, tree search etc seems to be good searching algorithms. Backpropagation, reinforcement learning seems like a good learning algorithms.

  > We want AI agents that can discover like we can, not which contain what we have discovered.

  This can be possible by meta-methods is what he says, Again $search$ and $learning$ seems to be good meta methods.

- Learnt that Mushrooms specificially (Schizophyllum Commune) has 23,328 distinct mating types. Humans only have Two... why are we just limited to two biological sexes?
  This is such a intriguing question because it hints at the evolution and selection processes. Much like why horses on plains don't have wheels. Nature favors the genetic diversity. But i like the idea of having multiple biological sexes
  I listened to [Nick Lane on this podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GMWxuYuxJI) due to which i have all these questions. I now want to read [The vital question](https://nick-lane.net/books/the-vital-question-why-is-life-the-way-it-is/) by Nick Lane

- I [setup my digital garden](voidash.github.io/digitalgarden) and here is the [motive](https://ash9.dev/digitalgarden/Experiments). Digital garden is a personal first shareable tool for me. I am a big believer of [zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/). As a painter, if you have to continuously move back and forth for fetching colors, then you aren't gonna paint properly as compared to having all the colors in a palette. Your thoughts are something similar... If you have to move back and forth to access your ideas, then it's a big hurdle.
  Essentially when you start writing you create hyperlink with already existing work or the new work evoked from that writing. With this approach one day you will find a connection between two domains that is novel and hopefully utilizable for all of us.

- Idea: A upwork style dating app where people would swipe right then answer bunch of questions for a match request. Receiving end chooses the best among of them + photos. This may weed out most of the superficials in attention deficit world blemished by the body distortion.
  So i further expanded the idea and registered the domain [terminal.beauty](terminal.beauty)
  terminal.beauty is terminal-first dating app. SSH into a minimal interface to connect with others. No swiping, just keystrokes.
  To use it simply type this in your terminal

  `ssh  http://terminal.beauty`

- Tinkering is one my core philosophies. It means "to make small changes to something, to repair, improve or understand it". [If you don't tinker, you don't have taste](https://seated.ro/blog/tinkering-a-lost-art)

- Reading "cartoon's guide to genetics". Also reading debt the first 5000 years

- Here is [my take on Richard Sutton and Andrej Karpathy](https://ash9.dev/digitalgarden/On-Richard-Sutton-and-Andrej-Karpathy). Basically condensation of ideas from Dwarkesh podcast.
  I will try to condense it down to two lines. Read more for info
  Andrej: [OpenAI plays Hide and seek and breaks the game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu56xVlZ40M)
  Sutton: what will you do without a goal? LLMs don't have any goals.

- [Would you bet on 100 CNC machines or 100 lawyers](https://geohot.github.io//blog/jekyll/update/2025/10/19/solution-is-simple.html) is where infamous [geohot](https://geohot.github.io//blog/) talks about democracy featuring the photo of the Nepal Sept 8 protest.
  A democracy will continue to exist up until the time the voters discover that they can vote themselves generous gifts. Like old people are enticed with allowance.

- From the book Debt: First 5000 years,
  \> Unless people consider themselves enemies, if the need is considered great enough, or the cost considered reasonable enough, the principle of "from each according to their abilities, to each according to their needs" will be assumed to apply.

  > Calculations are cold, ruthless but exact. Calculations were created to quantify the moral obligations. Calculations makes obligations transferrable from father to a child. Calculations make feudal lord possible.

- Copy pasting in NTFS is still a problem in MacOS in 2025.
  I downloaded Mounty and then had to restart in safe mode to enable kernel extension modules then i could copy, paste finally.

  - [Git Difftool](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-difftool) is pretty handy way to look for diffs.
    `git difftool --tool=nvimdiff main`
