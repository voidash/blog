- My home server is coming along. powered by [openmediavault](https://www.openmediavault.org/) whose tag is "Data | Sovereignty | Made | Easy". These are the people who have [same goal as me](ash9.dev/about) maintaining something that brings power back to you.
	- [git.fell-truck.ts.net](https://git.fell-truck.ts.net/) for my self hosted forgejo git server.
	- [omv.fell-truck.ts.net](https://omv.fell-truck.ts.net/#/login) for my vaultwarden server
	I also have [immich](https://immich.app/), [zotero](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-zotero) and [netbootxyz](https://github.com/netbootxyz/docker-netbootxyz) setup already and further plan to have pdf tools, jellyfin on my device.


- Veritasium video ["You've been playing the game of life wrong"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBluLfX2F_k) goes through "Power curve Vs Normal curve". Events that have additive effects follow the gaussian distribution like height, exam scores etc.   Events that are multiplicative where event build on top of each where events compound, where extremes dominate totals follow the power distribution like  Earthquakes,  Forest fires, Wealth distribution to views on youtube videos. he main highlight point of the video is"persistence(tenacity) vs consistence(uniformity)". . Keep on showing up and trying bunch of things until you are lucky enough to basket one rare extreme event. One such example is VCs persistently putting money on various domains knowing all the investment is going to be absorbed by one lucky company that succeeds. This is why one paper snowballs a researcher, one video defines a Youtuber career.
	> I always used to ponder why people used to over attribute success over skill, but these were the smart people who knew Talent != outcome, effort != reward, fairness !=equality. They knew it's persistently looking for luck by showing up.

	> My tail event will come because i vow that 2026 is going to be year of me being in places i am not yet qualified for and i plan to do it all the way down.

 - I am glad i finally watched ["12 angry men"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12_Angry_Men_(1957_film)) . I got a chance for a change. I had this inherent prejudice that old movies couldn't capture the intricacies modern cameras,  modern VFX with evolved direction can. I still think avengers in 1957 won't look good as the one in 2007 but they weren't putting out the plot like avengers in that Era. The very constraints of that era allowed for smoother story telling in format i was completely oblivious to. Acting, delivery, direction are timeless.

- https://www.commandlinefu.com/commands/browse for all the interesting commands to explore.

- If you haven't tried [OvertheWire Bandit](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/) , then i suggest you try it. It's a interesting sets of challenges. It exposes you with sets of unix commands integral to basic terminal mastery. I tried back in 2019 and i felt like trying again today and i could butter through level 1 - 15 like in a hour or so with only man pages.

- Did i ever tell you the [Definition of Insanity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKMMCPeiQoc) ? Watch the video
  [Vaas(Micheal Mando)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Mando) is my favorite game character.

- Dec 25th and i see improvements. Good fucking improvements and i am back on track.

- Commit earlier, expose sooner

- [Behaviors that alter your genes to improve your health and performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijdpvG24IkE) is excellent episode by [Andrew Huberman](https://www.youtube.com/@hubermanlab). While there is nothing profound other than how rapid adaptation works, I got to learn about [[lymphatic system]].  Lot of the talk is focused about [Haenyo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haenyeo) women of korea and [Bajau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sama-Bajau) people of Indonesia who have bigger spleen which allows them to dive underwater for longer period of time.

- Of all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It would be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron's cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience - C.S Lewis

-  Some day you will be old enough to start reading fairy tales again. And my interests in fiction has quadrupled in a last month. I started reading [White Nights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Nights_(short_story)) by Fyodor Dostoevsky.

- Since [Experiments](https://ash9.dev/digitalgarden/Experiments) are big part of my life. I want to ask a doctor what are their take on experiments. There is a human cost to what they do, so naturally it's full of constraints. They can't genetically modify humans, they can't prescribe experimental medicines, or try out the latest surgical method just by looking at the youtube video.  I also want to ask about supplements since i have started taking some of it and i want to know from first hand experience.
	- what kind of experimentation are doctors allowed to do? within standard care? like dosage tweaks, off label use etc.
	- what is uncertainty to you? for engineers they can shut down the entire internet and face no consequence. There is business cost to uncertainty which seems not as big as human cost.
	- Do you like malpractice law? If malpractice law didn't exist would you still be doctor?
	- why are high risk surgeries allowed, but low risk genetic experiments aren't?
	- How rapid medicine changes?
I want to know  "experimenting under constraints vs experimenting without them"
