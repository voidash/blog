-  Google defines agency as "one's ability to act on their will.".   [How to become more agentic](https://usefulfictions.substack.com/p/how-to-be-more-agentic) outlines the following
	 - You should face rejection early in your career. Apply for jobs you really don't think you'll get.
	 - seek real feedback. Here is my [feedback form](https://www.admonymous.co/voidash) . FYI it's anonymous
	 - increase your surface area of luck. The person says that more you are confident that conversation is likely to be relevant, less the opportunities.
	 - assume everything is learnable.
	 - learn to set boundaries. you have to set the time when you will not take action on any calls and then set a time when effort is not tolerated.
	 I want to emphasize on the last item on the list.  The world benefits from a person being passive. The distraction dystopia created by the internet is designed to snatch way the agency. Boundaries are really important to set. Being mindful about the time you spend is itself a hard thing to do, but you can just start by listing out all the activities you remember and give it a good or a bad score.

- Git bisect is a powerful tool.

	```
	git bisect start
	git bisect bad <commit-hash>
	git bisect good <commit-hash/tag>
	git run ./run_something.sh
	git bisect log # to show what has been done so far
    ```

- [The Trustless Manifesto](https://trustlessness.eth.limo/general/2025/11/11/the-trustless-manifesto.html) . It separates the ethos of organizations that enforce "privacy by policy" with "privacy by design", orgs that follow "don't be evil" with "impossible to be evil."
	 Trustlessness is not a feature to add after the fact. It is the thing itself. Without it, everything else - efficiency, UX, scalability is a decoration on a fragile core.

	 if simplicity comes from trust, it is not simplicity but a surrender.

	I wonder if something similar to "arrow's impossibility theorem" in democracy applies to trustlessness. I don't know if true Trustlessness is even possible.

- Geohot writes on [individual sovereignty](https://geohot.github.io/blog/jekyll/update/2021/07/11/individual-sovereignty.html) "We will abolish scarcity; then there will be nothing for them to steal they can't have for free". Alright it sounds utopian. But it's not defining what scarcity is in the first place.

- [The conscience of a hacker](https://phrack.org/issues/7/3)
	 "Yes, I am a criminal.  My crime is that of curiosity.  My crime is
	that of judging people by what they say and think, not what they look like. My crime is that of outsmarting you, something that you will never forgive me for."
   Btw phrack is a good hackerzine.

- Talked with one of my friend [Nirjal](https://nirjalpaudel.com.np/), and he was giving me examples of him being **more right** in certain case when tackling the nuances and i immediately thought about community blog [lesswrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/)

- [You should reverse any advice you hear](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/03/24/should-you-reverse-any-advice-you-hear/). If the algorithm pushes you content that shows you to take more risks, you should be asking yourself the importance of secure future and then if you are reading all about financial security then you should be looking if risk is worthwhile. Reverse the advices you hear, and see if it benefits you.

- [The company man](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/JH6tJhYpnoCfFqAct/the-company-man) describes fentanyl zombies. The ones who are applying RL to optimize the distraction dystopia. The tiktokification, the lootboxes and all the instant dopamine jizz.

- TIL [hors d'oeuvre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hors_d%27oeuvre) is a small dish served before a meal in Europe. it's designed to be eaten by hand.

- [Blood Meridian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_Meridian) looks like a good read. I grabbed a copy and listening to booktubers about it since. There is some hints of [Gnosticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnosticism) and seems incredibly graphic and bloody.

- [10 types of less wrong post](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Gi3v6j5QiiFku39s6/10-types-of-lesswrong-post). I found a new hobby. Hold and behold, i will be writing about these again and again
